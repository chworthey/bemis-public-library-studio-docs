# Cleanliness Checklist

@TODO: Does this make sense to put here?

Many diseases and conditions can be prevented through proper hygiene practices, such as covering your coughs and sneezes, washing hands, and keeping equipment that is handled with your hands clean.

Cold germs can live on surfaces for up to one week. The coronavirus can live from a few hours to a few days.

## Before Using Studio Checklist
- Are you sick? If so, please refrain from using the Studio and don't come inside the library.
- Food or drink, other than a sealable water bottle, is not permitted. Make sure you don't have those or you may be banned from future use.
- Have you washed your hands? See [Washing Hands](#washing-hands) for more information.

## After Using Studio Checklist
@TODO: Ask

## While Using Studio
- Try not to touch your mouth, face, hair, and nose at any time.
- If you cough or sneeze, cover it and keep it away from the equipment. Wash your hands immediately when necessary.
- Be vigilant if you're working with paper or potentially dangerous equipment. If you become injured, seek help and first aid straight away and refrain from getting bodily fluids on the equipment. If there's an emergency, call 911.

## Washing Hands
Washing your hands is easy, and it's one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Follow these five steps every time.

1. **Wet** your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
2. **Lather** your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3. **Scrub** your hands **for at least 20 seconds**. Need a timer? Hum the "Happy Birthday" song from beginning to end twice.
4. **Rinse** your hands well under clean, running water.
5. **Dry** your hands using a clean towel or an air dryer.
